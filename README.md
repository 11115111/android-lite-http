lite-http-android
=================

A simple, intelligent and flexible HTTP client for Android. With LiteHttp you can make HTTP request with only one line of code! It supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS and PATCH request types. LiteHttp could convert a java model to the parameter of http request and rander the response JSON as a java model intelligently. And you can implement the abstract class DataParser to parse inputstream to which you want.
